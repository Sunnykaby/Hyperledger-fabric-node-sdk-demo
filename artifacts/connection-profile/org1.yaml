# The client section is SDK-specific. The sample below is for the node.js SDK
#
client:
  # Which organization does this application instance belong to? The value is the name of an org
  # defined under "organizations"
  organization: Org1

  # set connection timeouts for the peer and orderer for the client
  connection:
    timeout:
      peer:
        # the timeout in seconds to be used on requests to a peer,
        # for example 'sendTransactionProposal'
        endorser: 120
        # the timeout in seconds to be used by applications when waiting for an
        # event to occur. This time should be used in a javascript timer object
        # that will cancel the event registration with the event hub instance.
        eventHub: 60
        # the timeout in seconds to be used when setting up the connection
        # with the peer's event hub. If the peer does not acknowledge the
        # connection within the time, the application will be notified over the
        # error callback if provided.
        eventReg: 3
      # the timeout in seconds to be used on request to the orderer,
      # for example
      orderer: 30

  # Since the node.js SDK supports pluggable KV stores, the properties under "credentialStore"
  # are implementation specific
  credentialStore:
    # Specific to FileKeyValueStore.js. Can be others if using an alternative impl. For instance,
    # CouchDBKeyValueStore.js would require an object here for properties like url, db name, etc.
    path: "/tmp/hfc-kvs/org1"

    # Specific to the CryptoSuite implementation. Software-based implementations like
    # CryptoSuite_ECDSA_AES.js requires a key store. PKCS#11 based implementations does
    # not.
    cryptoStore:
      # Specific to the underlying KeyValueStore that backs the crypto key store.
